- [The Perfect Table](./table/index.html)


### Notes

To enable a table without overflow or max-height on larger devices the folowing class'
`scroll-max-sm`, `scroll-max-md`,`scroll-max-lg` 
could could be applied to define how narrow the viewport should be before `overflow-x: auto` and `max-height: xx;` are applied to these breakpoints.
The class is applied to the table-wrapper element. What class to apply is defined by how wide the amount of table-data is. 
This decision could be made by inteligent code or by the CMS editor.
